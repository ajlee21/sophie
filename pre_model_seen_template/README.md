Here we use an existing trained VAE model and simulate a background dataset using a template experiment that is included in the training dataset (i.e. the datasets used to train the VAE model).

## Usage
1. Create a configuration and metadata files for your analysis. 

See [example configuration file]().
When editing this configuration file, use a text editor instead of excel.

The definition for each paramter in the configuation file is describe below:

Parameters for input data files and directories to create

| Name | Description |
| :--- | :---------- |
| base_dir| str: Root directory containing analysis subdirectories. By default the path is one level up from where the scripts are run.|
| local_dir| str: Parent directory on local machine to store intermediate results. Make sure to end path name with "/"|
| dataset_name| str: Name for analysis directory, which contains the notebooks being run. For example, this analysis directory is named "pre_model_seen_template".|
| normalized_compendium_filename | str: The location of the normalized compendium gene expression data file. Normalized data can be found here: [recount2 normalized](https://storage.googleapis.com/recount2/normalized_recount2_compendium.tsv), [Powers et al. normalized](https://storage.googleapis.com/powers_et_al/normalized_rani_compendium_filename.tsv), [P. aeruginosa normalized](https://storage.googleapis.com/pseudomonas/normalized_pseudomonas_compendium_data.tsv).|
| experiment_to_sample_filename | str:  File mapping experiment ids to sample ids|
| metadata_delimiter | str:  Delimiter ("," or "\t") used in the metadata file that maps experiment id to sample ids|
| experiment_id_colname | str:  Header of experiment-to-sample metadata file corresponding to the column containing experiment ids. This is used to extract gene expression data associated with project_id|
| sample_id_colname | str:   Header of experiment-to-sample metadata file to indicate column containing sample ids.This is used to extract gene expression data associated with project_id|
| project_id | str:  The experiment id to use as template experiment. This experiment must be contained within the training dataset that was used to train the VAE. The id is using the values found in the <metadata_experiment_colname> column of the <experiment_to_sample_filename>. This <project_id> corresponds to a group of samples that were used to test an single hypothesis. This parameter is used to pull out the template expression data from the normalized compendium and to simulate data based on this experiment.|
| num_simulated| int: The number of experiments to simulate. Experiments are simulated by shifting the template experiment in the latent space.|
| vae_model_dir | str:  The location where the VAE model files (.h5) are stored.|
| scaler_filename | str: The location where the scaler file is stored. This file was generated during the VAE training process.|
| DE_method| str: "limma" or "DESeq". Differential expression method to use.|

Parameters for intermediate files created. Names of files need to be specified:

| Name | Description |
| :--- | :---------- |
| normalized_template_filename | str: Normalized template gene expression data filename.|
| raw_template_filename | str: Un-normalized template gene expression data filename. This file is generated by reverse transforming the data using the scaler_filename. The data in this raw_template filename will be used to compare gene expression changes in reference to a compendium of simulated experiments.|


2. Create metadata files that specify how samples within the selected template experiment should be grouped for the differential expression analysis. 
An example can be seen [here]()

3. Run notebooks in order
